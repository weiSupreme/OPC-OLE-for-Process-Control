# OPC demo
this demo is implemented using the the DLL-OPCAutomation.dll, the language is C#, the development environment is VS 2015. It can search for the local OPC server and then connect it, and the data from the server can be shown at the demo.

For a testing server, i choose the KINGVIEW software to test the demo, and it worked.
